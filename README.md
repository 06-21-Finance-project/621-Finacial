# 621-Financial

## Project Overview

In this modern-day, people have more interested in cryptocurrency and stock when compared to the past. The fact that they have a significant impact on the way people spend their money due to the risk of an investment that depends on people's decisions and data is terrifying. Moreover, we seek out a few websites that can effectively show the relation between news and the status of cryptocurrencies and stock. So, we came with a solution to solve this issue. Our web page will establish the relationship between the current events and the status of the stock market and cryptocurrencies, including the current investor trend(primary data), to guide the beginner investor on the right track.

## Features

* Display the market price of stocks and cryptocurrencies only the attractive ones.
* Display the news of various categories in the same page as the price of stocks and cryptocurrencies.
* The information is paired by the time.
* Users are able to see the relations between the income, age, the money spend on stocks and cryptocurrencies, and their interests on stocks and cryptocurrencies.
